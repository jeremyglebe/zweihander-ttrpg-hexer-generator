# Zweihander Hexer Character Stats Generator

You probably don't care about this project. It is only on GitHub for the free site hosting so that my friends can use it.

In the Zweihander RPG's supplement "Main Gauche" they introduce a character career called "Hexer" which is basically
1-for-1 a Witcher out of Sapkowski's novels. I loved the idea and wanted to make one. To better integrate with their
career system, players can become Hexers even when their characters are adults. (Unlike in the Witcher books) I still
wanted to play a character who went through the training as a child, so we came up with the fun idea of simulating
generating numerous candidates and finding one who survives the trials. 

Whichever "candidate" character survives drinking the mutagenic potions in the simulation is the one I will
use in game. All that really matters here is the stats, but I decided to randomly generate some names too for
a little extra fun. Characters will be listed in the order they are generated and the site will generate
characters until one survives.

In Zweihander the test is supposed to be "Standard" difficulty for young characters - but that isn't consistent
with the lore. (It is probably meant to make the risk not as severe for players wanting to transition to the
hexer career) I think that's lame and don't mind lots of characters dying so I am treating it
as an Arduous (-30%) test. Yes, its cruel. :)
